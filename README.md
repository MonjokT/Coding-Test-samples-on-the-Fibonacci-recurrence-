# Fibonacci Sequence Calculation Program

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming. It provides arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and subtraction.

## Development Environment

The program was developed using the C programming language. Here are the details of the development environment:

- Operating System: [Specify your operating system]

- Compiler: [Specify your compiler and its version]

## Compilation

To compile the source code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the source code is located.

3. Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```shell

   gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c

   ```

   Replace `fibonacci` with the desired output filename if needed.

## Execution

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the compilation step was successful and an executable file is generated.

2. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the executable is located.

3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell

   ./fibonacci

   ```

## Output

The program will output the results of the arithmetic operations and the calculated Fibonacci sequence based on the given input values.

Example output:

```

add: 16

mul: 20

sub: -4

fibo: 2

```

Feel free to customize this README file according to your specific development environment and any additional details you may want to include.



To compile and run the provided source code, follow the instructions below:

1. Save the code in a file with a ".c" extension, such as "main.c".

2. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the "main.c" file is located.

4. Compile the code using the following command:

   For GCC on Linux/macOS:

   ```

   gcc -o program main.c

   ```

   For GCC on Windows (using MinGW or Cygwin):

   ```

   gcc -o program.exe main.c

   ```

   This command will generate an executable file named "program" (or "program.exe" on Windows) in the same directory.

5. Run the compiled program by executing the following command:

   For Linux/macOS:

   ```

   ./program

   ```

   For Windows:

   ```

   program.exe

   ```

   The program will then execute and display the output on the console.

Note: Make sure you have a C compiler properly installed and configured on your system before attempting to compile the code. If you encounter any compilation errors, please ensure that your development environment is set up correctly and that all necessary libraries are available.

Also, ensure that you have freed the memory allocated for the nodes correctly in your program before exiting, as shown in the provided code example.

If you have any further questions or issues, please let me know.
